Project 2: Qirkat (Alquerque)

The ancient game of Qirkat (more commonly known by its Spanish name, Alquerque) is a forebear of checkers (draughts) and numerous other games throughout the world. It appears to be of middle-eastern origin, and to have been introduced into Europe by Moorish invaders. You can find more information in this article.

In this project, you will be writing a program to play this game. The program will incorporate an AI so that a single human player can play, although it will also provide options for completely manual play and for completely automated play. Your AI need not be terribly sophisticated, but must be able to find forced wins within some number of moves.
